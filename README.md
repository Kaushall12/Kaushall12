Hi Kaushal here,
MSc IT Student | Building Industry-Ready DevOps & Full-Stack Skills | Problem Solver 🚀
Hi, I'm Kaushal 👋

I’m an MSc (IT) student passionate about building scalable applications and understanding how real-world systems work.

My focus is on becoming industry-ready by combining:

• Strong programming fundamentals

• Full-stack development skills

• DevOps & Cloud practices

I actively work on hands-on projects and follow structured learning challenges like #90DaysOfDevOps to strengthen my practical knowledge in Linux, Git, Docker, CI/CD, and Cloud fundamentals.

I believe in learning by building, documenting my journey, and continuously improving every single day.

🌍  I'm based in 📍 Surat, Gujarat, India
